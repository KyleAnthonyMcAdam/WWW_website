                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The internet was originally designed by the military during the world war 2 era, but a prototype network was never build it made use of packet switching. Later on in the UK’s National Physical Laboratory, Donald Davies thought of new communication ways to make communication more responsive, and making it possible to communicate over large distances. A few years later after the construction of ARPANET, PRNET began to experiment satellite communication technology that used packet switching. It leaded to the evolution to TCP and IP, thus the birth of the internet we know today.</p>

                <h2>ARPANET and PRNET</h2>
                <p>The roots of the internet go back as far as the late 1930’s. During the cold war there was an urgent need to create a new model of a communication system capable of surviving a catastrophe such as a thermonuclear attack (Naughton, 2016). A researcher by the name Paul Baran came up with an idea to use a mesh network based on high levels of link redundancy as well as packet switching (digital communications technology). Baran’s design never became a reality, however he wasn’t the only one with this idea. Donald Davies wanted to introduce civilian applications and conceived the idea of packet switching to achieve his goals (Betes, 2015). A network that was capable of “resource-sharing” was needed by the US Defence Establishment as their machines were incompatible with each other. ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Networks) was built in record time while facing difficult challenges and by 1972 it was complete (Naughton, 2016).Technology (GPT) (Naughton, 2016).</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The internet has gone beyond the change of just its name. The network has seen to have expanded beyond the borders of its birthplace and has reached not only its neighbouring countries but the whole globe. In this age it’s very rare to go to a place and the destination has no internet, It’s a product which is inescapable. Its number of users as of January 2021 was seen to have recorded a calculation of 4.66 Billion active internet users worldwide. 59.5% of the global population and of that total 92.6% accessed the internet via mobile devices. But with it’s evolution, there’s also been an occurrence of a dark side, as it has evolved from a friendly research network to a hotbed of criminal activity such as identity theft, fraud, hacking and including a side which is not to be accessed at all…known as the Dark Web.
                The Dark web or the dark net is a part of the internet which is encrypted online content that is not indexed by search engines, it requires specific software or authorization to access it. All kinds of heinous activity occur there which is inhumane and disturbing.</p>
