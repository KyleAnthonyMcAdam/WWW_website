         Over the years, the web has become synonymous with the internet. This is a common misconception, as there are significant differences 
         between the two. The worldwide web is defined as a network of web pages found by their addresses. While the internet is defined as the networks of networks
          that provide the basis for the web. The web is one of the main ways of access the internet but it is not the only way you can use the 
          internet. With the creation of mobile apps and other similar technology’s the use of the world wide web has decreased and the use of the
           internet has increased

           <h2 >The Internet</h2> 
           The Internet can be seen as the “hardware”. It is a collection of networks that are
           connected to each other through the use of the TCP/IP protocol suite. It is a global system of 
           interconnected computer networks that links devices worldwide. The internet connects millions 
           of computers together. The internet makes it possible for any device to communicate with any other device. 
           Each device is independent from other devices.

           <h2>The Web</h2>
           The web is a collection of Web Pages that are found on the network of computers. It can be thought of as the “software” part. It is a way 
           to access information over the internet. Online content that is formatted in HTML and accessed
            via HTTP protocol. The web is an application that has been built on the internet. The web makes it 
            easier to access html documents that are linked together using hyperlinks, and makes it easier to access 
            the world wide web. <br><br>

        <div >
           The main difference is that the World Wide Web is merely one of the services that are provided by the Internet. Several other services
            exist on the Internet, such as e-mail, online chat services and file transfer services. Each of these services provide their own 
            benefits to both business and individuals.
